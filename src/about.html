  /r/Games is an echo chamber focusing on "informative" and "interesting" gaming

  The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) is a trade event for the video game
  industry. It is used by many developers, publishers, hardware manufacturers to
  lie and attention-whore as much as possible. It is aimed at video game
  "journalists" to meet and promote awareness and use of themselves. It aims to
  convinced gamers that advertisment is also the product.
