  recap: >-
    Sony pays Discord in exchange for goods and services. Many Gamers are happy,
    but still remain disappointed that such a deal took so long to happen in the
    first place. Despite the Gamers apparent disgust for vendor lock-in and
    exclusivity, the Gamers take great joy in admonishing Microsoft for not
    simply acquiring Discord earlier in the week. Some console Gamers show up,
    unaware of what Discord is and how it's better than current console chat
    solutions. This is answered by Gamers purchasing a Nitro subsription and
    reacting with the :KEKW: emote.

  recap: >-
    Google's Stadia product is up shit creek without a paddle, although it is
    unclear if they had a paddle in the first place. The Gamers, none of whom
    have actually used Google Stadia in the first place, rejoice. Many different
    factors are blamed for Stadia's apparent failure. The Gamers, all of whom
    are genius business executives, pinpoint the core issue as Google not being
    managed well and other Developers being too strong. One Gamer is especially
    angry over the addition of a search bar being way too late.

  recap: >-
    Blizzard is unable to maintain interest with its Gamers. The Gamers are
    angry about this, but even more angry about not understanding how revenue
    works. Everyone seems to be in agreement that Blizzard has lost it's Magic
    Touch™. Exec bonuses, nostalgia bait, and lack of senior staff are all
    speculated to be part of the reason why. The Final Fantasy XIV Gamers
    (with Heavensward expansion included in the free trial) show up to shill
    their game. They are unaware that the only people left playing WoW will
    never leave and will also never stop being upset at Classic.

  recap: >-
    343 Industries continues the war against its own Developers. The Gamers
    take a break from sending death threats to Developers of their favourite
    game to exercise some sympathy. Familiar points are once again brought up
    detailing why Studios are able work Developers like this. The Gamers
    conclude that crunch conditions are simply inevitable and nothing can be
    done to prevent it. Other Gamers seem to think this is neccessary given that
    Master Chief is late for his big Xbox Series X debut.

  comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/n6zq6h/the_yakuza_series_will_remain_a_turnbased_rpg/
  recap: >-
    The Yakuza series decides to use the marmite of video game mechanics. The
    Gamers speculate if this is a move to try keep things fresh, much like the
    futile gestures in a loveless marriage. Comparisons are made to Final
    Fantasy for no reason. The Gamers are generally optimistic about this new
    direction, and take this as an opportunity to list all the grievances they
    have with turn-based JRPG mechanics. A few Gamers declare the franchise as
    ruined forever.

  comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/n7a057/resident_evil_village_reached_100000_concurrent/
  recap: >-
    Resident Evil Village is having its fifteen minutes of fame.
    The Gamers are very proud of this and especially happy for Capcom, making
    sure to excessively praise the Japanese Developer to meet their daily quota.
    Factors that are praised for this popularity include, being a good PC port,
    the robustness of the game engine, and the nine foot tall vampire lady.
    Many Gamers are quick to point out some minor flaws, such as the large
    difficulty spike in the early levels that they found when watching the game
    being played on YouTube.

  comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/n7vp98/mass_effect_legendary_edition_will_let_you_use/
  recap: >-
    Bioware attempts to salvage its reputation with nostalgia bait. This is in
    the form of an option to make the game worse in their cashgrab remake.
    The Gamers can't decide if the Mako was even fun in the first place.
