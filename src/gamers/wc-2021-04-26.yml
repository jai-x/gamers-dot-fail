    A Gamer attempts to commit grevious bodily harm over not being able use a
    bunny outfit in a video game. The Gamers are delighted to see that even
    though the perpetrator is Chinese, being angry over video game cosmetics
    transcends international and cultural boundaries. Some Gamers are quick to
    blame the Chinese government's overzealous censoring of video games as being
    the actual root cause of a Gamer wishing to stab a Developer. Other Gamers
    assume the Developers are actually Japanese and begin incorrecting each
    other about asian racist sterotypes.

    The Developers of LittleBigPlanet struggle to keep the lights on. One of the
    Gamers is eager to tell everyone that their child has the hot gossip;
    Hackers are attacking the online servers. Gamers are horrified at the
    prospect, wondering how people could be so mean to do such a thing.
    One Gamer admonishes Sony over not handling their studios well. Many Gamers
    are surprised to learn that people still play LittleBigPlanet at all, and
    that it has sequels.

    Sony announces to its investors that they intend to spend money to make even
    more money. Several Gamers worry over the potential huge backlash that they
    themselves will create when Sony follows up on it's promise to buy Developer
    studios. PC Gamers and Microsoft are blamed for this future backlash.
    Several Gamers ponder why Sony should be exclusivly entitled to games
    produced by the studios they have bought and paid for. Consensus is not
    reached on this topic.

  recap: >-
    The CEO of Activision Blizzard takes a pay cut. Many Gamers fail in basic
    reading comprehesion of the headline and point to the CEO's past behaviour
    as the reason why. Some Gamers are very smug about this news, feeling that
    the pay cut serves as damage control for the layoffs made by Activision
    Blizzard last year. Other Gamers hastily begin to incorrect each other about
    how shareholder value is distributed.

    Activision Blizzard surrenders even more of its property to the propaganda
    division of the United States military-industrial complex. There is much
    lamentation by the Gamers over the state of project management within the
    video game industry, a topic which none of the Gamers know anything about.
    Some Gamers grieve over the death of a studio that was responsible for their
    favourite cashgrab remake. Battle Royale as a genre is blamed for this.

    Konami remembers that they aren't supposed to be making good video games
    anymore. The Gamers are in much of a fouour to determine the cause of this
    despite a more positive annoucement only weeks ago. All seven of the
    remaining Pro Evolution Soccer fans are in outrage. Some Gamers pine for the
    possibilty of a good Yu-Gi-Oh! video game being made in the future. If
    anything, this annoucement just gives me less to write about come E3.

  recap: >-
    The Billion dollar tantrum between Apple and Epic Games continues and the
    Gamers are eager to lap up any breadcrumbs that fall out of it. Microsoft is
    called the stand as an eyewitness and reveals which toys they don't want to
    share (and can't even remember to name correctly). The Gamers begin poorly
    explaining to each other the matter of legal proceedings while also fawning
    over their favourite corporation. Since no Gamer is prepared to switch
    allegiance in this ongoing feud, everyone takes to blaming console Gamers
    for these exclusivity deals existing in the first place.
