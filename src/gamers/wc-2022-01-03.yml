    Ken Levine is languishing in creativity.
    The Gamers seem unsurprised by this, given his current most advanced
    narrative device is Lego that is impossible to assemble.
    One Gamer does some finance napkin math and concludes that this lack of
    output is fine since the Developer is actually being utilised as some sort
    of video game skunkworks.
    Other Gamers use this thread as an opportunity to incorrect each other on
    how video game production works.
    Some Gamers miss Bioshock.

  recap: >-
    A Call of Duty cosmetic item has an abusable bug.
    Some Gamers believe this is simply a bug not caught before the holidays and
    take this as an opportunity to bring up workplace abuse at Activision-Blizzard.
    Other Gamers believe this skin was created maliciously to sell more skins and
    take this as an opportunity to bash Hi-Rez studio for their handling of
    Tribes: Ascend.

  recap: >-
    Suckerpunch studios makes a lot of money.
    Most of the Gamers seem content that there is success in creating a
    video game that is sold in exchange for a fair price.
    Other open world games are brought up in discussions that go nowhere.

  recap: >-
    SEGA tells a lie with a straight face.
    The Gamers are careful not to fall for this deception and declare that, much
    like paid cosmetics and micro-transactions, NFTs will never become accepted
    by the majority.
    Some Gamers point out that the Japanese government has trouble with making
    laws for the current internet and proceed to incorrect each other on the
    inner workings of the legislative process of a country they do not live in.
    The rest of the Gamers are quick to point out that NFTs seem functionally
    equivalent to existing in-game item collection, but only declare one of
    those systems as being an outright scam.

  recap: >-
    Riot Games engages in its annual marketing campaign.
    The Gamers, all of whom declare that they don't play League of Legends,
    ooh and ahh for the quality of the animated video.
    Gamers are divided on whether to praise Riot for their effective marketing
    or to admonish them for the crime of intentionally exposing many people to
    the League of Legends community.
    Many Gamers agree that Riot is becoming the "new Blizzard" and say this
    sincerely as if it was some sort of a compliment.

  recap: >-
    A social media manager engages in some playtime stat-padding.
    The Gamers, who usually love to measure games in terms of value for money by
    playtime, now wonder why a game should ever be that long in the first place.
    One Gamer worry that such a large playtime will mean that the developers
    will miss out on the crucial "Switch dads and moms" demographic.
    A quality vs quantity debate begins and promptly is stalled when no one can
    agree on the definition of "content".

  recap: >-
    The next From Software game is highly anticipated.
    This hype is declared "healthy" for some reason.
    Some Gamers show genuine concern for the profits of one developer being hurt
    by the release of a competing game.
    As this thread is primarily discussing disproportionate hype for an
    unreleased game, Silksong is brought up unprompted.
    Continuing yesterdays confusion, many Gamers wonder why Dying Light has so
    many fans in the first place.
