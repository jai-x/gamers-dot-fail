    Video Games are reported to be extremely popular and extremely profitable.
    Gamers feel that this article is wrong, putting the terms "video game"
    "most important" and "youth culture" under intense scrutiny to try and find
    out why so many people are gaming. Simultaneously, Gamers rush to
    congratulate themselves for partaking in a hobby that is now more accessible
    in the midst of a global pandemic. Amazon, a billion dollar
    mega-corporation, is admonished for not trying hard enough to make money
    from Gamers.

    GabeN says something about consoles, but no one can remember what he said as
    the video post is deleted. Gamers are in a tizzy with speculation. Could it
    be a port of Half-Life Alyx to PSVR? Could it be a new version of The
    Orange Box? One Gamer peeks into their crystal ball and believes that Gordon
    Freeman will be added to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Many Gamers, who really
    dislike it when Studios cheaply repackage old games onto a new platform,
    suggest that Valve cheaply repackage its games onto new consoles.

  recap: >-
    The latest Ratchet & Clank game is very shiny and new. Gamers take this as
    an opportunity to chide Nintendo for not making the Switch more powerful.
    Some Gamers seem genuinely concerned over the lack of sexual innuendo in the
    game's title. Gamers, who are known for being critical of games that
    sacrifice gameplay innovation for graphical quality, fawn over this trailer
    due to it's graphical quality and gameplay that remains the same from the
    previous games.

    Opinions of games "journalists" are collated for the viewing pleasure of the
    horde. Today's subject; Mass Effect Cashgrab Remake. Reception is generally
    positive, with Bioware's sins of Mass Effect Andromeda forgiven for this new
    wave of nostalgia bait. Gamers stumble over themselves to praise EA for the
    revolutionary practice of including two whole disks in the console
    packaging. None of the reviews that are aggregated in the original post are
    discussed.

  recap: >-
    The Australian government decides to stop being a prude over a video game.
    Gamers, whose perception of Australians comes entirely from mass media,
    wonder why anyone from Australia would ever object to coarse language and
    drug usage in a video game. One Gamer wishes they had millions of dollars
    to waste on making a version of this game to spite the Australian
    Government, as if they would notice or care. Other Gamers wonder why anyone
    even cares about the RPG genre at all.

    The ramifications of Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax is discovered.
    Gamers, all of whom were cheering at this acquisition news months ago, are
    in shock. Purchasing a Studio wholesale for exclusivity rights is decried
    as "slimy". Some Gamers think that Starfield will be a bad game, so this
    news doesn't matter at all. Other Gamers believe that Starfield is
    vapourware. One PS5 Gamer described themselves as being "hurt" from this
    news.

  recap: >-
    Final Fantasy XIV gets another console port. Gamers are happy that they are
    able to play this game on their console of choice while relaxing on their
    couch. This is seen as heresy to other Gamers, which results in dozens of
    comments of unsolicited advice in an attempt to get someone to connect their
    PC to their living room TV, and not stopping when told "no". Some Gamers
    wonder if the graphical quality will be good enough on console, or if the
    MMO menu navigation will map well to a console controller. One Gamer loudly
    proclaims they are not interested in this due to load times.
