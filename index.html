  Ken Levine is languishing in creativity. The Gamers seem unsurprised by this, given his current most advanced narrative device is Lego that is impossible to assemble. One Gamer does some finance napkin math and concludes that this lack of output is fine since the Developer is actually being utilised as some sort of video game skunkworks. Other Gamers use this thread as an opportunity to incorrect each other on how video game production works. Some Gamers miss Bioshock.

  A Call of Duty cosmetic item has an abusable bug. Some Gamers believe this is simply a bug not caught before the holidays and take this as an opportunity to bring up workplace abuse at Activision-Blizzard. Other Gamers believe this skin was created maliciously to sell more skins and take this as an opportunity to bash Hi-Rez studio for their handling of Tribes: Ascend.

  Suckerpunch studios makes a lot of money. Most of the Gamers seem content that there is success in creating a video game that is sold in exchange for a fair price. Other open world games are brought up in discussions that go nowhere.

  <br>
  SEGA tells a lie with a straight face. The Gamers are careful not to fall for this deception and declare that, much like paid cosmetics and micro-transactions, NFTs will never become accepted by the majority. Some Gamers point out that the Japanese government has trouble with making laws for the current internet and proceed to incorrect each other on the inner workings of the legislative process of a country they do not live in. The rest of the Gamers are quick to point out that NFTs seem functionally equivalent to existing in-game item collection, but only declare one of those systems as being an outright scam.

  Riot Games engages in its annual marketing campaign. The Gamers, all of whom declare that they don't play League of Legends, ooh and ahh for the quality of the animated video. Gamers are divided on whether to praise Riot for their effective marketing or to admonish them for the crime of intentionally exposing many people to the League of Legends community. Many Gamers agree that Riot is becoming the "new Blizzard" and say this sincerely as if it was some sort of a compliment.

  <br>
  A social media manager engages in some playtime stat-padding. The Gamers, who usually love to measure games in terms of value for money by playtime, now wonder why a game should ever be that long in the first place. One Gamer worry that such a large playtime will mean that the developers will miss out on the crucial "Switch dads and moms" demographic. A quality vs quantity debate begins and promptly is stalled when no one can agree on the definition of "content".

  The next From Software game is highly anticipated. This hype is declared "healthy" for some reason. Some Gamers show genuine concern for the profits of one developer being hurt by the release of a competing game. As this thread is primarily discussing disproportionate hype for an unreleased game, Silksong is brought up unprompted. Continuing yesterdays confusion, many Gamers wonder why Dying Light has so many fans in the first place.

  <br>
  Video Games are reported to be extremely popular and extremely profitable. Gamers feel that this article is wrong, putting the terms "video game" "most important" and "youth culture" under intense scrutiny to try and find out why so many people are gaming. Simultaneously, Gamers rush to congratulate themselves for partaking in a hobby that is now more accessible in the midst of a global pandemic. Amazon, a billion dollar mega-corporation, is admonished for not trying hard enough to make money from Gamers.

  GabeN says something about consoles, but no one can remember what he said as the video post is deleted. Gamers are in a tizzy with speculation. Could it be a port of Half-Life Alyx to PSVR? Could it be a new version of The Orange Box? One Gamer peeks into their crystal ball and believes that Gordon Freeman will be added to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Many Gamers, who really dislike it when Studios cheaply repackage old games onto a new platform, suggest that Valve cheaply repackage its games onto new consoles.

  <br>
  The latest Ratchet & Clank game is very shiny and new. Gamers take this as an opportunity to chide Nintendo for not making the Switch more powerful. Some Gamers seem genuinely concerned over the lack of sexual innuendo in the game's title. Gamers, who are known for being critical of games that sacrifice gameplay innovation for graphical quality, fawn over this trailer due to it's graphical quality and gameplay that remains the same from the previous games.

  Opinions of games "journalists" are collated for the viewing pleasure of the horde. Today's subject; Mass Effect Cashgrab Remake. Reception is generally positive, with Bioware's sins of Mass Effect Andromeda forgiven for this new wave of nostalgia bait. Gamers stumble over themselves to praise EA for the revolutionary practice of including two whole disks in the console packaging. None of the reviews that are aggregated in the original post are discussed.

  The Australian government decides to stop being a prude over a video game. Gamers, whose perception of Australians comes entirely from mass media, wonder why anyone from Australia would ever object to coarse language and drug usage in a video game. One Gamer wishes they had millions of dollars to waste on making a version of this game to spite the Australian Government, as if they would notice or care. Other Gamers wonder why anyone even cares about the RPG genre at all.

  <br>
  The ramifications of Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax is discovered. Gamers, all of whom were cheering at this acquisition news months ago, are in shock. Purchasing a Studio wholesale for exclusivity rights is decried as "slimy". Some Gamers think that Starfield will be a bad game, so this news doesn't matter at all. Other Gamers believe that Starfield is vapourware. One PS5 Gamer described themselves as being "hurt" from this news.

  <br>
  Final Fantasy XIV gets another console port. Gamers are happy that they are able to play this game on their console of choice while relaxing on their couch. This is seen as heresy to other Gamers, which results in dozens of comments of unsolicited advice in an attempt to get someone to connect their PC to their living room TV, and not stopping when told "no". Some Gamers wonder if the graphical quality will be good enough on console, or if the MMO menu navigation will map well to a console controller. One Gamer loudly proclaims they are not interested in this due to load times.
