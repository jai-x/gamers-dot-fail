  A Gamer attempts to commit grevious bodily harm over not being able use a bunny outfit in a video game. The Gamers are delighted to see that even though the perpetrator is Chinese, being angry over video game cosmetics transcends international and cultural boundaries. Some Gamers are quick to blame the Chinese government's overzealous censoring of video games as being the actual root cause of a Gamer wishing to stab a Developer. Other Gamers assume the Developers are actually Japanese and begin incorrecting each other about asian racist sterotypes.

  The Developers of LittleBigPlanet struggle to keep the lights on. One of the Gamers is eager to tell everyone that their child has the hot gossip; Hackers are attacking the online servers. Gamers are horrified at the prospect, wondering how people could be so mean to do such a thing. One Gamer admonishes Sony over not handling their studios well. Many Gamers are surprised to learn that people still play LittleBigPlanet at all, and that it has sequels.

  Sony announces to its investors that they intend to spend money to make even more money. Several Gamers worry over the potential huge backlash that they themselves will create when Sony follows up on it's promise to buy Developer studios. PC Gamers and Microsoft are blamed for this future backlash. Several Gamers ponder why Sony should be exclusivly entitled to games produced by the studios they have bought and paid for. Consensus is not reached on this topic.

  The CEO of Activision Blizzard takes a pay cut. Many Gamers fail in basic reading comprehesion of the headline and point to the CEO's past behaviour as the reason why. Some Gamers are very smug about this news, feeling that the pay cut serves as damage control for the layoffs made by Activision Blizzard last year. Other Gamers hastily begin to incorrect each other about how shareholder value is distributed.

  Activision Blizzard surrenders even more of its property to the propaganda division of the United States military-industrial complex. There is much lamentation by the Gamers over the state of project management within the video game industry, a topic which none of the Gamers know anything about. Some Gamers grieve over the death of a studio that was responsible for their favourite cashgrab remake. Battle Royale as a genre is blamed for this.

  Konami remembers that they aren't supposed to be making good video games anymore. The Gamers are in much of a fouour to determine the cause of this despite a more positive annoucement only weeks ago. All seven of the remaining Pro Evolution Soccer fans are in outrage. Some Gamers pine for the possibilty of a good Yu-Gi-Oh! video game being made in the future. If anything, this annoucement just gives me less to write about come E3.

  The Billion dollar tantrum between Apple and Epic Games continues and the Gamers are eager to lap up any breadcrumbs that fall out of it. Microsoft is called the stand as an eyewitness and reveals which toys they don't want to share (and can't even remember to name correctly). The Gamers begin poorly explaining to each other the matter of legal proceedings while also fawning over their favourite corporation. Since no Gamer is prepared to switch allegiance in this ongoing feud, everyone takes to blaming console Gamers for these exclusivity deals existing in the first place.
