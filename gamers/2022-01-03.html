  Ken Levine is languishing in creativity. The Gamers seem unsurprised by this, given his current most advanced narrative device is Lego that is impossible to assemble. One Gamer does some finance napkin math and concludes that this lack of output is fine since the Developer is actually being utilised as some sort of video game skunkworks. Other Gamers use this thread as an opportunity to incorrect each other on how video game production works. Some Gamers miss Bioshock.

  A Call of Duty cosmetic item has an abusable bug. Some Gamers believe this is simply a bug not caught before the holidays and take this as an opportunity to bring up workplace abuse at Activision-Blizzard. Other Gamers believe this skin was created maliciously to sell more skins and take this as an opportunity to bash Hi-Rez studio for their handling of Tribes: Ascend.

  Suckerpunch studios makes a lot of money. Most of the Gamers seem content that there is success in creating a video game that is sold in exchange for a fair price. Other open world games are brought up in discussions that go nowhere.

  SEGA tells a lie with a straight face. The Gamers are careful not to fall for this deception and declare that, much like paid cosmetics and micro-transactions, NFTs will never become accepted by the majority. Some Gamers point out that the Japanese government has trouble with making laws for the current internet and proceed to incorrect each other on the inner workings of the legislative process of a country they do not live in. The rest of the Gamers are quick to point out that NFTs seem functionally equivalent to existing in-game item collection, but only declare one of those systems as being an outright scam.

  Riot Games engages in its annual marketing campaign. The Gamers, all of whom declare that they don't play League of Legends, ooh and ahh for the quality of the animated video. Gamers are divided on whether to praise Riot for their effective marketing or to admonish them for the crime of intentionally exposing many people to the League of Legends community. Many Gamers agree that Riot is becoming the "new Blizzard" and say this sincerely as if it was some sort of a compliment.

  A social media manager engages in some playtime stat-padding. The Gamers, who usually love to measure games in terms of value for money by playtime, now wonder why a game should ever be that long in the first place. One Gamer worry that such a large playtime will mean that the developers will miss out on the crucial "Switch dads and moms" demographic. A quality vs quantity debate begins and promptly is stalled when no one can agree on the definition of "content".

  The next From Software game is highly anticipated. This hype is declared "healthy" for some reason. Some Gamers show genuine concern for the profits of one developer being hurt by the release of a competing game. As this thread is primarily discussing disproportionate hype for an unreleased game, Silksong is brought up unprompted. Continuing yesterdays confusion, many Gamers wonder why Dying Light has so many fans in the first place.
