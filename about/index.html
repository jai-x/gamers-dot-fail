<p>
  /r/Games is an echo chamber focusing on "informative" and "interesting" gaming
  content. Submissions are for the purpose of clickbait and intiating flamewars,
  not just with the goal of entertaining /r/SubredditDrama.

  The Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) is a trade event for the video game
  industry. It is used by many developers, publishers, hardware manufacturers to
  lie and attention-whore as much as possible. It is aimed at video game
  "journalists" to meet and promote awareness and use of themselves. It aims to
  convinced gamers that advertisment is also the product.

  This site is full of bullshit and you should not read it. Having read it, you
  should ignore it. You don't have to listen to this shit from some rando on the
  internet.
